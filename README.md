# Simple-PHP-GPIO
Control GPIO modules connected to a Raspberry Pi

This a very simple PHP scritp I wrote to control my bedside lamp with a relay module connected to a Raspberry Pi and my cell phone. It is very straight forward and simple to use.

# Requirements

```
sudo apt-get install lighttpd php
```

Yup, that simple. Once lighttpd (or apache2 if you prefer) and php are installed it is as simple putting the script in the /var/www/html folder.

You can access the script on the http://RASPBERRY IP/ where RASPBERRY IP is the ip adress of your Raspberry Pi.

Ideally your Raspberry Pi is connected to the Internet so bootstrap css script is loaded from the Internet.
